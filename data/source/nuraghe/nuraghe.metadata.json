    "short_description": "The nuraghi are massive, beehive-shaped stone towers built between 1600 and 1200 BCE, unique to Sardinia and numbering more than 7,000 across the island. Their exact purpose remains uncertain, but they likely served as fortresses, dwellings, temples, and symbols of power, forming the monumental legacy of the Nuragic civilisation."
