The stone still bears the scratches and blood he left trying to catch it—marks said to remain visible to anyone who seeks it along the Yew Tree Trail.

To this day, the gusts along the Stump are blamed not on the river or sea, but on that ancient, unholy struggle. #devil#saint#attrib

Other local lore adds witches and the Devil himself—sometimes as a hare, sometimes as a white rabbit—haunting the lonely church on its mound. #devil#demon#attrib
