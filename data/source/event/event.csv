46.419444,15.869444 Kurentovanje Carnival https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurentovanje Kurentovanje can be viewed as a ritualized spring-welcoming celebration in which masked figures (kurenti) perform noisy, symbolic actions meant to drive away winter and ensure fertility and renewal for the coming year. Although today the festival is a large public carnival, its central elements—costume, sound, and procession—reflect older beliefs about seasonal transition and restoring balance to the community and natural world.

The purpose of the custom is traditionally said to bring good luck to the town, with residents offering whisky and money to ensure the continuity of the ritual. #august
