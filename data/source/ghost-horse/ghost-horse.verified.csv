In one version collected by folklorist Mabel Peacock, the eerie creature turns out not to be supernatural at all but just a prankster in disguise, and the name later inspired a local Morris dancing group. #ghost-horse#attrib

The tale survives mainly as a reported haunting rather than a full narrative, with versions noting that it may date back as far as the 1700s. #ghost-horse#attrib
