Other tales credit him with stranger feats still, from sprouting trees out of tankards to summoning self-beheading birds. #wizard#attrib

Another night, the woman’s father attacked a mysterious cat he believed was the witch in animal form; the next day the suspected wizard was found injured and soon died — confirming, in local belief, that the cat and the man were one and the same. #wizard#attrib
