52.6503222,-0.4801407 The Stamford Bull-run https://lincolnshirefolktalesproject.com/2024/03/06/the-stamford-bull-run The Stamford bull-run was a centuries-long local tradition in which a bull was chased through the town each year, later remembered through a legendary origin story involving William de Warenne witnessing bulls fighting for a cow. The colourful tale of how the tradition began is almost certainly mythic, but it survives as the folk explanation for a real — and notoriously brutal — ritual that lasted until its ban in 1839. #folklore#attrib

His odd lifestyle and outsider status led some locals to treat him almost like a bogle or uncanny figure, a reputation later picked up in song and local lore. #folklore#attrib

He spends three nights in a haunted mill, where strange creatures and boggarts appear — among them a huge Black Dog and a wild Tatterfoal-like horse. Instead of panicking, he calmly deals with each apparition and refuses to be frightened. After the third night he wins the miller’s daughter as his reward, but still hasn’t truly learned how to shudder. #folklore#attrib

The sculpture’s imagery—wild men bearing clubs and a brood of children—suggests strength and lineage, giving a possible folkloric origin for the East Midlands’ best-known wild man tale. #wildman#folklore#attrib
