  "short_description": "In folklore, a changeling is a fairy child left in place of a human infant, taken out of love or belief that the human child is exceptionally beautiful or destined for a life of wonder. In reality, the changeling myth was often a tragic explanation for infants born with (at the time) unexplained illnesses, such that parents sometimes resorted to cruel superstitions in an attempt to 'drive out' the fairy imposter."
