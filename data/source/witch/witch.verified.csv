With the spell broken, the horse moved on and the strange witch vanished, ending a tale that feels like the fragment of a much longer story. #witch#attrib

Forced to ride one, Billy is chased across Dunston Beck until his mount collapses and the witches reclaim it, leaving Shuffler to be fished out later and suitably humbled. #witch#attrib

Suspected of Devil-worship on the marsh, she’s tried, survives mob justice at the river, and finally vanishes, leaving only witch-tales and whispers behind. #witch#attrib

The tale survives as an origin-legend for the town’s nickname, though no one knows the real reason. #witch#name#attrib
