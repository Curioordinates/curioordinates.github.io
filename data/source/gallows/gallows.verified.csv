The replica gibbet stands as a grim reminder of a crime that shocked the region and of the era’s belief in public punishment as moral deterrence.

Prisoners were paraded through London to the dock in a public spectacle led by the High Court Marshal carrying a silver oar, symbolising the Admiralty’s authority.

Though stories tell of a murderer and a compassionate baker both meeting this fate, historical records suggest such executions at Caxton were likely legend rather than fact.

A plaque explains it originally stood on Gallows Hillock, where local barons administered justice until their feudal powers ended in 1747.
