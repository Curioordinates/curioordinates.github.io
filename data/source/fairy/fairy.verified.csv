Terrified, she fled back to the farm, but her parents knew that no mortal saw the fairies without them coming after her, and a local wise woman warned that they would return at midnight. The family tried to keep the house utterly silent, but the farm dog barked as the fairies arrived and, in the confusion, the girl vanished. Only by bringing three curious gifts—a glow-worm for light without fire, a lizard’s shed skin, and an unboned chick within a newly laid egg—could her father appease the little folk. #approx
