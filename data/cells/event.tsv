46.41944	15.86944	Kurentovanje Carnival	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurentovanje	Kurentovanje can be viewed as a ritualized spring-welcoming celebration in which masked figures (kurenti) perform noisy, symbolic actions meant to drive away winter and ensure fertility and renewal for the coming year. Although today the festival is a large public carnival, its central elements—costume, sound, and procession—reflect older beliefs about seasonal transition and restoring balance to the community and natural world.
55.9897	-3.39369	Burryman's Parade - 2nd Friday in August	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Burryman	The Burryman parade features a man completely covered in thousands of sticky burrs, walking awkwardly through South Queensferry supported by two flower-decorated poles, with attendants guiding him along a long route of pubs and homes. The purpose of the custom is traditionally said to bring good luck to the town, with residents offering whisky and money to ensure the continuity of the ritual.
53.4898	-0.84798	Haxey Hood	https://lincolnshirefolktalesproject.com/2024/02/20/the-haxey-hood	Each Twelfth Night, villagers in Haxey play a rough, slow-moving scrum game to carry a leather “hood” to one of several pubs, guided by a lord, a fool, and the boggins. The hood stays at the winning pub for the year, and a popular origin tale says the custom began when Lady de Mowbray’s riding hood blew away and peasants chased it	#attrib
