55.21119	-2.06111	Winters Gibbet	https://www.davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	Steng Cross Gibbet, or Winter’s Gibbet, near Otterburn in Northumberland, marks the site where the corpse of murderer William Winter was once displayed in chains after his 1791 execution. The replica gibbet stands as a grim reminder of a crime that shocked the region and of the era’s belief in public punishment as moral deterrence.
54.22193	-1.41476	Thomas Busby's Gallows	https://www.davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	Thomas Busby was executed by hanging near his inn in 1702 for murdering his father-in-law, after which his body was displayed in chains at the crossroads. Before facing the gallows, he cursed his favourite chair in the pub, claiming anyone who sat in it would die violently — a legend that has endured for centuries.
51.50699	-0.05099	Execution Dock	https://www.davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	Execution Dock in Wapping was the site where, for over 400 years, pirates and seafaring criminals were hanged under Admiralty law, their gallows positioned below the Thames’ low-tide mark. Prisoners were paraded through London to the dock in a public spectacle led by the High Court Marshal carrying a silver oar, symbolising the Admiralty’s authority.
52.22826	-0.10281	Caxton Gibbet	https://www.davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	Caxton Gibbet, located along the old Ermine Street near Cambridge, is linked by folklore to the horrific practice of live gibbeting—leaving convicts to die slowly in iron cages. Though stories tell of a murderer and a compassionate baker both meeting this fate, historical records suggest such executions at Caxton were likely legend rather than fact.
51.35792	-1.47747	Combe Gibbet	https://www.davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	Combe Gibbet, standing on Gallows Down in Berkshire, was erected in 1676 to display the bodies of lovers George Broomham and Dorothy Newman after they murdered Broomham’s wife and son. Now a replica, it has become a local landmark and the starting point for the annual Combe Gibbet Race, blending grim history with modern recreation.
52.63728	-1.46699	Bilstone Gibbet	http://davidcastleton.net/gibbets-gallows-executions-england/	The Bilstone Gibbet in Leicestershire once displayed the body of John “Topsy Turvey” Massey, a violent farmhand hanged in 1801 for murdering his wife after a drunken quarrel. The original, weathered post still stands today, said to evoke eerie sensations among locals who dare to approach it after dark.
57.08721	-2.71299	Gibbet Stone	https://www.abdn.ac.uk/elphinstone/resources/bbaf/category/4/342/	The Gallows Stone, believed to be the socket that once held a gibbet post, was relocated in 1962 to the north side of the road by the Deeside Field Club. A plaque explains it originally stood on Gallows Hillock, where local barons administered justice until their feudal powers ended in 1747.
