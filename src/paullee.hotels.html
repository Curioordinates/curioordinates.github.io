<center><H3><u>UK Haunted Hotels</u></H3></center>

Welcome to my on-going project to categorise haunted hotels in the UK, aimed at encouraging people to explore the country and perhaps learn something of our haunted heritage, and our rich tapestry of history. Please visit regularly for frequent updates!
<br>
If you don't see a famous hotel in my listing, its because of work I am doing on my ghost survey, where I have been contacting thousands of venues asking about their current "haunted" status and whether they have experienced anything paranormal in the last few years. I felt it approrpriate
to omit locations that have reported nothing - it saves you time and money if you are planning to stay at the hotel. I apologise for the lack of hotels (to date) in Northern Ireland. There main candidate was the Ballygally Castle - but they informed me that all has been quiet for a while now.
<br>
<br>
<b>Please note that I can't be held liable for the non-appearance of any ghosts or associated phenomena; or even if room numbers have changed since my write-up! Most of the hotels below are unresponsive to any ghost reports, so if you do experience something, please <a href="mailto:paul@paullee.com">email me here</a></b>

An old Victorian lady in white, a little hazy but otherwise solid, has been seen walking through various rooms and along corridors at night, looking out of the windows; she has also been seen in the upstairs bedrooms where she has been seen crying while seated on the bed. Sometimes there are reports of rose perfume that accompany her. Additionally, cushions sometimes have an impression as if someone had been seated upon them. There have also been reports of poltergeist-like activity including footsteps, lights turning off, doors being found unlocked, a clock falling off the wall and pan lids flying out of the cupboard in the kitchen, landing with a clatter. Staff have reported feeling "a cool hand" on their forehead and a heavy weight on their beds during the night. Interestingly, the hauntings intensified after a small room, probably used by servants, was found in the loft. There is also a story of a little girl who was seen by a cleaner, who had felt something touch her skirt. The cleaner left the next day!

The ghost here is said to be Eliza Kleineger, the maid to Mrs Standish who owned the building. She used to collect jewelry from her employees and it is thought that she tried to return to collect them when the original building was ravaged in a fire. Sadly, she perished. After the house was rebuilt as a hotel, her phantom was seen under the central gable, where the servant's staircase was originally located - and where her body had been found in 1886. Her expression is described as worried.

A newspaper article in 2024 gave some details on the phantom nun claimed to haunt this property: "The building dates back to 1760, and had a chapel run by nuns as a local school. It is said that one of the nuns fell pregnant and committed suicide. To conceal the scandal, her body was bricked up in an alcove by the other nuns. The hotel was damaged by a bomb in WWII, and her skeleton was discovered by workmen who were carrying out some repairs. The bones were hid elsewhere and since, a figure in brown is said to roam the hotel, especially room 160." Other apparitions include a ghostly maid in "old fashioned clothing", an old man in a tweed suit [possibly the 'figure in brown' above?] in the cellar and, in guest rooms, figures in grey habits have been seen; another (?) figure is said to rise "as if climbing stairs that don't exist." Scratching and whispering sounds, a door being rattled, guests feeling as if they are being pinned down and a basket of toiletries being hurled into the air have also been experienced. Most of the reported phenomena are said to occur in the afore mentioned room 160.

This inn is said to be haunted by a woman in white clothing. The landlord's son saw a "light shape, almost like a small cloud" which moved along the length of the downstairs bar. The lady in white was also seen upstairs on the landing; in addition, strange creaking noises have been heard coming from one of the bedrooms. Glasses have also moved by themselves and some smash onto the floor, in an area that used to be accommodation; glasses and beer mats have also been found on the floor having previously been placed on shelves. Also, the door to the fridge behind the bar has been found open in the morning when the landlord was sure that it had been closed the previous night.

After turning around the corner to the High Street, the coach stops outside the Greyhound, where the coachman glances at the pub - and the whole vehicle vanishes from sight.

A grey figure has been sighted here, thought variously to be a soldier from either the First World War or a Roundhead from the English Civil War; in this latter story, the soldier was an officer who was recuperating at the Swan after losing his leg during practising manoeuvres. He is said to have embarked on a visit to the many hostelries and tried to arrange the services of a prostitute. When he couldn't "perform", she told him that he wouldn't get a refund and after a blazing row, the pair were ejected. The prostitute, by some means, incurred an injury to the head when the pair went to the river Ouse and she ended up in the water, her body eventually washed up. The solider either hung himself in the attic of the Swan, or also drowned himself in the river. As far as other phenomena are concerned, a guest felt someone tugging at him during the night. He thought it was his wife but she denied it. Soon after, a pair of hands grabbed him, pulled him out of the bed and dumped him on the floor. Needless to say, the couple soon left.

Activity has been reported in many areas, such as the attic, restaurant, stables and room 3. There are unconfirmed reports of a phantom highwayman, but a lot of the activity seems to be poltergeist-like, including beer tankards behind the bar being rattled (accompanied by a coldness in the room). "Communication" via bangings on the wall seem to indicate the phantom of a lady in her 30s who had previously worked here but was not popular with her employer. More recently, a ladies toilet was found to be locked from the inside - there was no window through which one could crawl, and the gap below the door was not high enough to allow exit!

A "Grey Lady" has been seen in this inn, and her perfume detected too. It is said that she may have the victim of an accident when a horse and coach pulled into the archway, not noticing that she was there. A crying baby was heard on one occasion, and was the sound was found to be coming from a 3rd floor corridor, but the location could not be ascertained. A guest also complained that his bed was shaken and he heard heavy noises (like furniture being moved) in the room next to his, No.3. But there was no-one booked in that room that night. A manageress also noted the chain to a bell was swinging as if someone was tugging it - but the bell was making no sound at all. She also saw a dark shadow in the otherwise empty kitchens. There have also been reports of interference with electric equipment, too.

Something pounded on the door around 3 AM. He got up and realised he was the only one there. Nothing outside and nothing on CCTV when he checked either. Second was after they locked up the restaurant for the night. He was outside talking to 2 staff when they all saw a black shape go past the lit till in the room and blot it out,thinking they had left someone in they went back but nobody there. Last was as he locked up the bar one night something blew in his ear!That really scared him."

The spectral activity seems to be focussed in rooms 8 and 9 where a figure has been seen; in the latter room, some say that it is the ghost of a chambermaid. An icy presence has also been felt in the cellar, said to be John Davies, who fell down the steps here in 1690 (or 1609) - some versions of the tale say that he was carrying a knife in his hand which killed him as he fell. Another phantom said to have been encountered here originally started off in the stable block; the man in question died there after he knocked over a lantern and set fire to the building and himself. In the cellar, he makes noises and turns beer pumps on and off. Cold draughts, and the feeling of being touched or prodded have also been experienced.

There are stories of long conversations taking place downstairs during the night (some report say that these seem to be in an unfamiliar language), accompanied by the sound of horses and items being unloaded in the courtyard. Rooms 3, 4, 5 and 6 are said to be particularly "badly" haunted; for instance, a lady in one of these rooms woke to find her television on. When she reached for the remote control, and it flew out of her hand. She found the control in the morning - under the bed! This is the same location that a cleaner found the guest's computer hard drive. There is no explanation as to how it got there. In room 5, there is said to be the apparition of "a distressed mother and her crying baby." There are many other reports here too!

Judge Jeffreys is said to haunt this building, as does a young woman in a long black flowing cloak who appears at the front of the hotel (or walks from the courtyard to South Street, where she vanishes according to some reports); a child's face has also been reported in one of the windows in the bar. A local legend is that members of staff were sent to investigate a smell coming from a well in the courtyard; they never returned but cries for help have allegedly been heard ever since. Another version of this tale is that two men died when they went to repair the long neglected well, but died after being overcome by "an uncommon stench." A third man barely survived. Another legend blames a cockatrice (a mythical creature part lizard, part rooster) for their deaths. Additionally, a spectral boy in old fashioned clothing has been seen crying in this hotel, but he runs off when people approach him. A little girl in a long dress has been seen seated on the steps of the manager's accommodation, seemingly waiting for someone. In the courtyard, a man carrying a whip and wearing a three cornered hat was glimpsed; also in the same area, a "solid looking" woman in a Puritan dresses has also been observed. It is said that it seems as if she is walking up some stairs which no longer exist; first the top half of her body is seen, and then her legs and feet. Also to be seen are "three toga-clad ghosts who march through a wall."In the bedrooms, a bed was felt moving - it faced the corner where a priest hole is to be found; when the furniture in the room was reorganised, the disturbances stopped. Additionally, boxes and other items are found in disarray in the attic, and next door, hand dryers in a disused bathroom often activate by themselves. Taps have also been found turned on, and a former owner's dog reacted in a terrified fashion when taken to the attic. A recent report says that a customer's father was disturbed by someone tapping him in the early hours of the morning, followed by a little boy who ran up and down the corridor, laughing.

Disembodied voices are heard in this pub, especially the toilets; it is reputed that the hotel was built on the site of a medieval graveyard. A gentleman named Wadham Strangeways is said to be one of the phantoms in the hotel; he was accidentally killed when the Duke of Monmouth landed at Lyme Regis in 1685 with 82 men to claim the throne from his uncle, King James II. The Duke's makeshift army tried to raise an army and to seek news of the royal army. Strangeways took refuge in the hotel and in the resultant skirmish, a stray shot struck him, dying soon afterwards. Another man, said to have been killed at the same time, is also seen in the same room, which is apparently sealed up. A middle aged lady has also been seen in the reception, chatting to a companion who is invisible to onlookers, and the voice of a child heard in the lounge.

The ghost of "Emma" (real name Martha Railton) has been encountered here. In 1713 she fell in love with a local teenager, Roger Wrightson, but their respective parents were bitter rivals, running separate inns. The lovers had to meet in secret but after one meeting on the moorland Roger contracted a serious fever and a few days later his parents agreed that he should see Martha, but her parents disagreed. Roger died of his ailment and Martha died heartbroken immediately afterwards. The parents agreed that they should be buried together. Some reports say that her loved one has also appeared at the inn. On a recent occasion, a guest to the inn wasn't too impressed about the noise of a late night party but when he entered the room, the sound stopped - and he noticed a girl in a green party dress in the middle of the room, who vanished moments later. Roman soldiers are also said to have been seen here, after they were killed by the locals who had "taken a dislike to them." They are said to appear on the anniversary of the deaths - but reports fail to specify when this is. A dark haired man has been seen next to the fireplace (perhaps Roger Wrightson?), and a man in a bowler hat has been observed in various parts of the pub, as has a lady in a grey Victorian dress. Meanwhile, in the cellar, a boy of about 12 years old has been encountered; he was thrown here as punishment and never allowed to leave. A strange shimmering cloud of darkness was also seen in the mirror in the dining room. People also report the sensation of being touched and pushed, and of hearing strange noises in the night.

In the late 18th century, Bridget Bellasyse was betrothed to marry Bobby Shafto (who is reputed, but unlikely to have been the owner of the hall at the time) but his eagerness for travel led him to postpone their marriage until he returned from his latest excursion. When he returned he married Anne Duncombe instead and Bridget died two weeks of a broken heart after hearing the news (though some sources say that she perished a fortnight beforehand of TB). The "Grey Lady" seen looking out of the bridal suite and walking along the lower reaches of the hall is said to be her, and a fictitious addendum to the basic story is that a servant saw her when she tried to visit him at the hall and she hid in a casket which locked after her. Her cries were muffled and unable to escape, she passed away, her body being found decades later. There is an impressive catalogue of other apparitions here; a lady in a pink hat and Elizabethan garb in the Eden Bar; "Charlotte" in the reception area; another (?) "Grey Lady"; a man who gazes out a window (despite his clothing dating from the Victorian era, some choose to identify him as Bobby Shafto); and perhaps spectral children in the attic where strange lighting effects have occurred. There are also tales of footsteps in the Shafto Hall, dogs barking, doors slamming, running feet and dark shadows that pass through walls.

There are numerous ghosts claimed for this building, now a hotel. These include two ex-owners of the estate, Dorothy Allan and her sister Ann. Also seen apparently is a coachman who was dismissed for getting a maid pregnant and who hung himself. His spirit is sometimes seen in the ground, wailing piteously. The most malevolent phantom is The Tartan Lady, the living embodiment of a long since destroyed painting. Prince William, the Duke of Cumberland stayed at the Grange loaded with treasures ransacked at Culloden and he left a painting of a lady in tartan. In April 1821, owner George Allan's cousin stopped overnight and the ghost of the lady in the painting appeared to him that night, materialising through his room door. He shot at the figure and later found the painting had bullet holes in it. Although the picture was burnt, the ghost is still seen to this day, it is said.

When she told them she had no intention of doing so, she was murdered and threw her body in a well in the cellar. The priests found a local lady, who died soon afterwhile and sent her to a convent, trying to convince Sir Ralph that his wife had left to become a nun. Some versions of the aftermath say that Sir Ralph did not believe this and had the priests executed - ghostly monks have also been seen in the castle grounds. A young girl aged 5 or 6 in 19th century garb, noises, objects moving, lights and a voice whispering in someone's ear have all been experienced, too. Additionally, a headless horseman is said to ride from the Castle to Finchale Priory, usually on stormy nights. Sounds of clashing swords, men dying and horses charging have been heard in the castle grounds and nearby woodlands.

"Light anomalies" have been reported in this room, too. Other ghosts include a "chubby man" who sits on the edge of people's beds; a young woman who was murdered in the 18th century by the Hawkers (or Hawkhurst) Smugglers Gang when they felt she knew too much about their operations; and a female form seated in a chair near the fireplace in room 1 (clothes left on this chair are found to have become damp overnight). However, some versions of this tale say that this happened in room 17 and that a guest woke in the night to see the chair rocking by itself - it is said that the chair has since been removed. Additionally, in room 10, a man was seen to walk through the bathroom wall and across the room before vanishing when he met the wall behind the bed; the couple who witnessed this spent the night asleep downstairs on the couch and refused to return to the room. Room 18 is the haunt of an old man, while in room 5, a dark haired young woman has been seen. In room 19, a man in old fashioned clothes has been claimed (perhaps the "Chubby Man" above?); a guest who stayed in the room saw the figure sitting at the end of her bed, and in a state of terror, she retired to a nearby room with "the matress pulled around her head"! A barman also experienced the unnerving sight (possibly in room 16?) of all the bottles falling off the shelf - he left very soon afterwards!

A female ghost seen in a guest room is said to be Kitty Canham, the Beautiful Bigamist, who lived in the adjacent cottage. She married the local vicar Alexander Gough and then vanished (because of his "domineering" ways according to some); while away, she married another husband, John Primrose, Lord Delmeny. There are conflicting reports about her death; in one version, it is related that she and her first husband made their peace as she lay dying of consumption; some versions state that she confessed to her second husband that she was still married to Gough; others state that she returned to the village with her second husband before passing away; while yet more tales tell how she just wanted to buried in her home village and died elsewhere. Her ghost has been blamed on a moving wardrobe and sheets have been messed with suggesting someone has slept in the bed. It is also said that "paranormal activity" has been felt in the neighbouring cottage, presumably the one in which Kitty lived for a while...?

Alice Miller, murdered here in 1633 (or 1638!) soon after she found out that she was pregnant by an influential figure, walks between rooms 5 and 6 through a connecting door which was later bricked up; she is also said to appear as a blur and come up to people and touch them or even talk to them. A guest woke in early in the morning and saw a rocking chair start to move and a lady materialised; when she asked if the guest was all right; he feebly replied "yes!". She nodded and slowly vanished, leaving the chair still rocking. An assistant manager also mentioned waking up at some point to see the chair rocking and a white shape appear. Some identify this spectrally infested room as No.10. There is also a woman in Edwardian costume and a Cavalier who walked through a closed door and then through a window; groups report strange events in the cellar too. There is also said to be an unspecified ghost - perhaps Alice? - in the kitchen. The sound of panicking children have also been heard, a spectral remnant of a fire in the 1970s where people died in the inferno; a small boy has also been reputed to be seen in the parliament room, too. Its mainly children who see him, too but whether he is connected to this fire is not known. Doors opening and closing, items moving, lights swinging, cold spots and other phenomena have been experienced too, including one interesting occurrence in the bar area which is below where Alice used to live; the cushions were found to be stacked up by a nightwatchman - they had been in situ moments before on his previous round. One further phantom is said to be that of a hooded monk, seen in the area near the reception and in the corridors, usually in the early hours of the morning. According to the story, he died trying to rescue children from a fire at the inn "several hundred years ago."

Also in the kitchen, a serving spoon was seen to swing by itself although nothing else on the rack was moving and a notice by the dishwasher was flung from the wall. Other phenomena include; a small boy in a blue top seen passing the bottom of the cellar steps; the smell of extinguished candles and flowers behind the bar; the smell of burnt toast and tobacco outside room 8; a man (seen from outside) in the bay window area - the pub was locked at the time; a man standing by the front door who subsequently vanished; and a male figure walking towards the fireplace.

He has also been seen in the cellar and undercroft. A staff member was so scared at seeing the phantom that she resigned from her job. Another ghost is said to be Lord Lovelace, who was attacked and died here after locals heard him voicing his support for King James in the hotel (James' Catholic sympathies in a Protestant country had caused much dissent). The spectral Cavalier observed here is thought to be Bulstrode Whitelock who was shot and later died in a room in the hotel, which is named after him. One employee looked up from working in the room to see the ghost pointing a gun at his head! Another spectre, reported to have been the phantom of a man who was tortured by the Romans is thought to be responsible for wailing noises. Footsteps, objects being flung around and a fireball that vanished when it hit a mirror have also been experienced here too.

There are stories of people being pushed in the cellar and in other parts of the building, the sound of children; most famously, a pint of beer was flung from a table on to the floor (menus have also been seen dragged along the table) - it is also at this location that a spectral woman has been seen. She is thought to be the nanny of two children who died in a fire here. In "The Oak Suite" a man in a dark costume has been observed and a guest felt someone get into bed with him. Additionally, light effects and the drapes on the four poster bed moving by themselves have been noted. Another "dark man" in a cloak is to be encoutered in the loft area.

A ghostly woman holding a baby has been seen occasionally (usually on the stairs) and "eerie noises" including wailing (especially on stormy nights) heard. It is thought that these phenomena are the results of the antics of the then landlord, William Clavers who lived here with his wife and child in 1760. Clavers had financial problems and elected to adopt the life of a highwayman. Before one escapade, his wife, carrying their child, begged him not to go, but in his haste (and probably fuelled by alcohol), he pushed past her down the stairs and rushed out to embark on his crime spree. During the night, he was pursued by the authorities and took to seeking refuge in his inn, whereupon he found his wife at the bottom of the stairs with a broken neck and their dead baby beside her; they had died when he rushed past them and they fell to their deaths. After arriving at the inn, his armed pursuers found the tragic corpses - and the ghost of Claver's wife hovering in the parlour. Clavers had tried to conceal the bodies when he had arrived home but their spectres had appeared to him and they left him a gibbering wreck and he killed himself. In modern times, the chef, who stays overnight, sometimes hears the sound of someone kicking the door in - and a noise similar to someone falling down the stairs. The proprietor also had the unnerving experience of putting out the fire for the night - within ten seconds of him turning away, the logs had been put back on, and the fire had been reignited. A previous landlord also heard rattling doors and saw a spectral figure "looming" over his bed, and a chair had been pulled out from a table that had been left unattended for a very short period.

Clanking metallic sounds, sometimes accompanied by a strong gust of wind and the rarely seen apparition of a lady in a blue dress have been experienced; the pub's website says that, "It was [in 1931] the 'Lady in Blue', began to make a nuisance of herself. She is rumoured to appear as a very life-like woman with long dark hair (occasionally wearing a hood) in the back-rooms of the pub and likes to move things around." The ghost is said to have settled down after the pub was sold in 1934, but "there have been reported sightings of her within the last 10 years!". It is thought that the metallic sounds were the rattling of chains by a previous landlord who committed suicide here.

The medieval vaults are haunted by two ghosts, a young boy who accompanies an older man, named Tom, who may have been a cellar man. The ghost of "Molly" has been seen on the ground floor; she was a chamber maid and killed herself after her affections were rejected. In one sighting, only her top half was seen, due to the floor level having changed over the years. Some accounts of her tale says that she appears at 2am, leaving a trail of coldness in her wake. In the "Assembly Rooms" on the 1st floor, is a rotund gentleman named Beau, in Georgian garb, who looks out of the bay windows, and in a nearby corridor is a "Grey Lady" in victorian clothing.

This is said to occur at 9.30pm, with a descent occurring at 3.30am. The footsteps are said to sound like they are on bare wooden boards - but the stairs are carpetted. The footsteps are blamed, according to legend, on the wife of a fisherman who accidentally let a guide light on top of the inn go out, which resulted in his death and those of several of his companions at sea. In remorse, she is said to ensure in death that the light is lit (even though it no longer exists).

A lady in white has been seen at the top of the stairs; she has long black hair and her face is impossible to discern, being hidden in the shadows. She is said to also walk the corridors, staring at the floor and disappearing after a few paces. Additionally, a clunking noise has been heard that passed around the house and someone reported feeling electrified by something that came up from under the floor. Thumping noises, a radio turning on and off by itself, and footsteps emanating from empty rooms have been experienced - as has a woman in a white gown who was seen in a mirror in the bar area (perhaps the same phantom mentioned above?) A spectral coach and horses was also seen in the grounds but the details are open to debate; some say that this happened only once, while some say that he was seen often and was merely a horseman who rode towards the house being veering off and disappearing into a nearby lake.

The spirit here is said to return to the hall after nightfall on Christmas Eve but it is has been seen on other occasions too. According to the story, a French governess in the 18th century called Lucette became pregnant with an army officer who was staying at the hall one Christmas. He promised to return in the New Year but never did and, being in such a condition out of wedlock, was regarded with disdain until she threw herself to her death from a nearby stone bridge. She was buried in an unmarked grave. In some versions of the tale, the officer returned and learned her fate before dying in a duel with Lucette's brother. Now, Lucette walks the hall and also the stone bridge. But some say that she has been seen all year round; one guest even said that he saw her sitting on the end of their bed.

There are many ghosts associated with this building! The inn was a notorious meeting place of ruffians and scoundrels in the past, and one of them returns to the inn as a spectre. A legend is that it is the ghost of a highwayman who had a torch thrust in his face after a robbery was thwarted by the coachman; another version is that the incident happened in the pub itself when soldiers arrived to break up the motley gathering. The ghost is reported to wear a cloak to hide his disfigured face. Another ghost is that of a maid who was murdered by a rat catcher when she rejected his advances; her spirit is said to cower in the corner with a terrified look on her face. Additionally, a former owner of the inn, wearing a cravate and smoking jacket returns to the apartments that overlook Bailgate, where the White Hart is located. However, other accounts say he is a man who was robbed during a stay and the shock killed him. Yet another ghost is that of a man in a military outfit, who is seen on the top floor. The young son of one of the owners has mentioned seeing a lady in a long dress who had tucked him into bed at night on occasion. Ghostly children have been heard parading noisily through the corridors, too. A 17th century cleric roams the underground passages; and outside the hotel, people have heard the sounds of soldiers, possibly Roman, marching or stagecoaches (which have sometimes been seen). Finally, one account reports a phantom cat! In decades gone by, guests have told tales of a dancing ball of light, cutlery and food being thrown off a table, and the sound of a small "explosion."

During a stop at the hotel in October and November 2019, the staff informed me that the building used to be a coaching inn, with the stables now being the bar. Although not experienced for some 5 years now, phantom horses used to be seen and heard in this area. There are also recent stories of a figure being seen by cleaning staff on the landing near rooms 301 and 304.

The main hub of the hauntings seem to be room 29, which had previously been numbered 10, and before that, 12. A guest on his honeymoon noted a cold spot outside his room and said that he felt as if someone was pushing the door closed as he tried to open it. Footsteps had been heard pacing up and down the corridor - and then soon after, actually in the room. The same guest saw a young girl, apparently solid, in the room on two consecutive nights. On other nights, he saw the wardrobe handle moving making a rapping sound, and soon aftewards noted TV picture was flickering - and then he saw the aerial lead moving in a whipping fashion. His experiences culimated in waking to find the ghost sitting on his bed looking at him. The figure arose, causing the mattress to rise and, keeping a gaze on him, walked off - and vanished. The guest described the ghost as 12-13 years old, with fair hair, wearing along white gown and a garland around her neck, with her outfit having "puffed out sleeves." The figure was described as almost self illuminating. The manager showed him a portrait and he identified top half of the face as "his" girl, although most of the picture was of someone older - landlady Betty Radcliffe, who died in 1829. Perhaps for this reason, the ghost has been nicknamed "Betty" and has been experienced by members of staff; housekeepers jokingly asked "Betty" if she'd been a good girl and let the guests get sleep, at which point, the room went cold and the staff members fled! In rooms 6 and 8 (though the rooms have probably been renumbered since the mid 1990s), a white haze floated past a staff member into the wall. Children have also been heard playing in empty rooms (where crying has also been heard), keys have been rattled in a lock, and a phantom monk has been seen too, amongst other sightings.

The kitchen is, or at least was, the source of much poltergeist activity including things falling off shelves and plates being ejected in a row from an old oven that was used to keep them warm; and a hot plate of roast potatoes flew off hot plates onto the floor in the restaurant area. A guest who took a room in the lodgings above the pub complained the next day of loud voices downstairs at 2am, and of hearing a young couple running down the upstairs corridor giggling and laughing followed by a horrible voice shouting at them. The guest was told that he was the only guest and there was no "lock in." Another guest had the unsettling experience of someone getting into her bed at night. There has also been the sighting of an old man sitting in the corner of the pub after it had been closed and the alarms were about to be set (the barlady who saw him did not stay long enough to get a better look!). In previous years, the old landlady's young grandchildren had a Scalectrix set which would come on by itself, and in the early 2000s, a figure appeared in a photograph taken in the bar, seemingly wearing a Tudor ruff.

Doors would also lock and unlock themselves and a woman has been heard crying. Guests have also reported their pet dogs reacted strangely too. It is not known if these ghosts persist (the above reports are from before 2011) but a very recent incident told of all the sauces held in a pot in the restaurant flying out and being thrown around. The landlord blamed this on the ghostly children in the premises.

This pub is said to be haunted but the phenomena is very low-key, consisting of the smell of cigar smoke, the sound of footsteps upstairs when no-one is there, and the feeling of someone walking past you. As of February 2023, the current proprietors informed me, “We have heard various stories over the years about people having seen and heard ghosts ... My wife and I personally haven't experienced much apart the odd noise but staff past and present have reported feeling like someone is around at night and the smell of rose perfume in a certain part of the building. There have also been housekeeping staff that say the hoover will move on its own in a certain bedroom but this hasn't happened for quite a few years now ... I didn't know about the cigar smell but the footsteps could be what my wife and I have heard before, we live upstairs and my wife has woke up in the night with the sound of steps but we put it down to the building heating or cooling down.”

The story is that the ghost here is called "Arthur", a blacksmith whose shop was on the site of the hotel. He was hanged when Cromwell's forces arrived and asked him to provide shoes for their horses but as a Royalist, Arthur refused - and was duly executed. Tobacco smoke, the spectre of a young woman, a door rattling, glasses moving off the shelves and the sensation of being pushed in the back has also occurred here. The phantom is said to be encountered in the wine cellar and two of the bedrooms, including one that overlooks the walnut tree where the blacksmith was hanged.

In room 3, there is a "Grey Lady" but details are scant. A spectral Cavalier has also been observed, as has a little girl in the restaurant, and "Mrs Priddy", though she has not been seen for some time. The crying of a young child has been heard (probably the girl in the restaurant?), and someone felt as if they had been touched, accompanied by a giggle. Poltergeist-like activity has also been noticed too, with lights dimming and going on and off, the loud sound of furniture moving in "The Cromwell Room" and more dangerously, a manager being struck on the face by a glass and a bottle of orange juice; this same member of staff also had ashtrays explode in front of his face.

A weight pressing a guest firmly down in bed, moving furniture, and a picture that jumps off the wall have been mentioned as occurring here. This latter picture depicts the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, and legend has it that it is her spectre who inhabits these walls, particularly two of the top rooms and the staircase where she walked en route to her execution (it is on the staircase that strong perfume has also been detected). She has been seen at the bottom of the foot of the bed in one of these rooms, wearing a long black dress. She has also been observed looking out of a window but in this case, only by men. Additionally, cold spots, footsteps and a woman singing and crying have been mentioned; this latter incident was reported on the anniversary of Mary's execution and is said to go on for hours on the top floor. In some of the bedrooms, various phenomena have been reported, such as a swirling white mist and a figure in a long black dress. Interestingly, it is said that manifestations occur after alterations have been made to the building.

Some of these reports may refer to the same phantom - for instance, the "Grey Lady" may possibly be the nun as that is how witnesses once described it, saying that it looked as if they were viewing it "through a murky glass." Two other phantoms are a former landlord and the barmaid whom he killed due to jealousy; he afterwards killed himself. It seems that the two never meet as spirits.

It has been suggested in the past that the ghost here was a cook who had hanged himself in the kitchen from the overhead pipes. Reported phenomena include staff hearing crashing noises from the cellar, which was locked. As staff entered the cellar they saw a crate of mixers lift into the air and being flung across the room; the noises previously heard were made by two crates of empty mixer bottles and a crate of empty beer bottles being hurled around. There is, or was, said to be poltergeist activity in the bar, dining room and kitchen. Items, such as order pads, corkscrews, and a knife used to slice lemons, would go missing and later turn up in the dining room, kitchen or occasionally behind the reception desk. In addition, beer taps would be turned off in the cellar. On one occasion, a staff member who had been left to hold the fort in an otherwise empty hotel heard the noise of the front door swinging open, and looking up, she saw a tall figure wearing a long black coat (like a coachman's) and top hat, walk into the lobby and then go behind reception desk. When she checked there was no-one there.

The "Grey Lady" seen here is believed to be Maud de Lucy, the widow of Sir Thomas, the man who created the castle. She died falling from the battlements and this has been re-enacted on several occasions; other versions of her death claim that she jumped from a window after hearing of his death at the Battle of Shrewsbury after keeping watch for his return from that very same window. Guests say that her phantom has been seen at that window, muttering her husband's name before jumping to her fate. She has also been seen in the Great Hall. A phantom bell and French voices have also been reported, as have visions of the castle being attacked by soldiers and burning; this may refer to an attack upon the castle in 1405 by Henry V's forces when the building was left derelict for some time

Mysterious puddles of water have unaccountably turned up too.

The management of this hotel claim that there are 60 spectres in this one building! A large black figure charging out of room 20 and trying to break through a fire door, "William" (who murdered his family 200 years ago) in rooms 4, 7, 28, 29 and 30 and the corridors, an airman outside rooms 15-19, an old lady with a walking stick, dark shadows, and a young boy and girl seen and heard laughing in the bar area (where she died after banging her head on the hearth) are some of the phantoms here. Naturally, there are many conflicting stories; for instance, rooms 28, 29 and 30 are reported to be the epicentre of acitivy - the first of these was where the French DeVere family planned to stay but they were murdered by a gypsy and their bodies dumped at sea. Screams have been attributed to a lady named Eleanor who killed herself and her unborn child after she was told her husband Jack had been lost at sea. The ghost of Parson John is said to be seen in September. He was killed when he was brewing ale and the tap on the cask blew off and hit him on the head, killing him instantly; his phantom is said to walk, holding the tap aloft. There are obviously many tales associated with this building!

An old lady haunts the nursery, kneeling at the foot of a bed; she may also have been seen walking the corridors and has been noted as looking "confused and lost." Elsewhere, a phantom butler goes about his business; people are reported to have even engaged him in conversation. A fleeting shape in the lobby area is also reported too where it passes through a wall; however, this may the old lady mentioned above. The ghosts are said to be so real that they are mistaken for flesh and bloody living people. There is another, albeit non-corporeal phantom who likes to hide people's belongings; they are eventually found in unexpected places. This entity may also be responsible for making strange noises that prompt guests to investigate the cause. Natually, there is no explanation.

Historical reports talk of small balls of light rolling along the floor, a mead-making monk in the former scullery, a former owner who sits on a creaky fireside chair, a "wraith-like servant girl" and a spectre who moves firelighters around. More recently, the owner from 2001-23 talked of the ghost of a boy who liked to turn the volume on the music system up and down, and stopped when rebuked; this young wraith was also blamed for CDs being hurled around. The owner also talked of the time that he was locked out and his partner had to let him back in; and a sceptical punter who announced his disbelief in ghosts and had his pint of Guinness taken from his hand. It hovered in mid air for three seconds and then smashed on the floor. The current owner of the inn also told the press that while he hadn't experienced anything himself, some of his staff have heard their names called out when they were in a room by themselves. They'd also seen an individual "at an unsociable" hour and had followed them into the next room but they were no longer there. Intriguingly, the CCTV had recorded certain "unexplainable" things. The current proprietor also said there were about 5 ghosts, two children and three adults.

A theory exists that in the 1920s, a chambermaid was sacked when her colleagues informed management that she was indulging in pilfering from guest's rooms, and that her ghost has returned to enact revenge on her old place of work. In the 1990s at least, the maids on the third floor report that their supply carts have been tipped over or disturbed and the contents scattered along the corridors. No one has ever seen the miscreant and this always occurs while the maids are working inside the rooms.

The attack on her home is believed to have a severe effect on her health and she died only four months later. Her ghost is still seen, hiding as she did during that riot. She has also been seen indoors, especially the east wing. The sad ghost of Mary Ann Chaworth, whose dalliance with Lord Byron was spurned by her family and then married into the Musters family has also been seen in the corridors.

The ghost of King Charles has been seen in the suite named after him. This was also the place where he spent his last night of freedom as he was on the run after he had lost the Civil War. His depressed-looking spectre is also seen along the corridor that leads to his rooms. A happy, smiling lady ghost from the 18th century also haunts this hotel, specifically in the toilet which used to be a small bedroom. Most active is a man in Regency costume of velvet. He has been seen "shuffling" along the various corridors of the building.

It is said that he likes to frequent Room 3. Highwayman like Duval used to congregate here to spend their booty. He was eventually arrested in London and executed. A ghostly lady who dresses in black is seen carrying a baby whom it is believed she neglected; she was later charged with its murder. She has been seen both inside and outside the Hotel and once caused a passing motorist to break sharply when the ghostly lady rushed out in front of her.

The Oak Room is said to be haunted by Mad Maude, a nun who fell in love with a monk and was burnt at the stake for her dalliance. When the building was a monastery, the Oak Room (No.7) was thought to be her cell and at least one person complained of excessive heat during the night; additionally, some people report coldness too! Lights switching on and off has also occurred. A dairymaid who fell to her death haunts the tower, and a coach and horses drives into the yard before vanishing.

In the 17th century, a businessman named Jasper would often stop here on his way to Shrewsbury; however, one time on a freezing cold night, he meekly explained that he had lost his money in his stockmarket speculations. The innkeeper refused to give him credit despite Jasper's generosity in the past and even when the wayward businessman promised to repay any debt he would incur. That night, the innkeeper dropped dead from shock, having seen something awful in a cupboard that was invisible to the rest of his patrons. The next day, the body of Jasper was also found, frozen to death under a hedge, his face a mask of happiness. Since then, the ghost of Jasper has been seen in the corridors and in a fireside chair.

Guests have reported icy fingers on their back in room 211, their clothing being thrown out of a wardrobe and the sound of applause followed by the noise of someone hurrying away; the ghost apparently does not like women (one reported having her hair yanked, and some versions of this story say that she was pulled out of bed, again by the hair). However, the ghost here has been known to caress the faces of men. A couple asked to be placed in a haunted room and were allocated room 212; they only stayed a few hours before checking out. They did not divulge what they had experienced, but a later guest claimed that "Henry VIII" was in the room! A phantom man and his dog has been seen walking along the corridor between rooms 232 and 233. This same figure may also be the one seen in the James I room, seated at the window; he and his dog have also been seen in a room in the modern wing of the hotel, where they emerge from a wall, cross the room and disappear into the opposite wall. Footsteps have also been heard in the Great Hall (also known as "The Prince Charles Suite"); in the afore mentioned James I suite, a night porter continually heard his name being called out. It occurred so often that he got used to it! A "Lady in Black" is said to have been a regular visitor; in 1974 she was seen dressed in a contemporary mini skirt and walked through a parked car outside the hotel. It is not known if she still appears.

A figure has been seen in the cellar, but its features are ill defined, described as a dense white mist although one report said that it is female. A rarely, and briefly seen figure is a military man in a seat in the main lounge; he is described as wearing a bright red army tunic. The most frequent phantom visitor is that of the Old Grey Lady, usually seen in the grand ballroom, glancing around as if looking for someone, and then seemingly satisfied, she walks down to the reception (she is sometimes described as wearing blue clothing). Poltergeist-like activity has been reported, with a door opening itself obligingly for an approaching porter, a piano playing by itself and candlesticks being lifted into the air. A room above the stairs where an unspecified crime took place is the source of groans and moans and a lit candle has been observed in the window.

Eccentric Jack Mytton's lifestyle was so wild - and alcohol laced - that he was declared insane by doctors procured by his own mother and he was locked up before dying in a debtor's prison awaiting trial. His coffin was allowed to be housed in the Hotel the night before his funeral, allowing people to come and pay their respects. It is to this building that Jack returns (specifically the drawing room) where he is seen staring out of the window at the nearby river - some say he also walks through the hotel, on his birthday, September 30th. He is also said to pinch the bottoms  of female staff, and running across the roof and through
the car park before leaping into the river.

Allegedly, there are 10-12 active sightings of ghosts in this hotel. The spectre of a young girl who killed herself has sometimes been seen, her body hanging from a beam in the Prince Phillip Suite; this may be the phantom reported in room 5, who likes to remove the bed clothes of single men. This young lady, according to legend, is that of a maid who killed herself after she was abandoned at the altar on her wedding day. Also seen is an elderly man wearing a nightshirt and carrying a candle as if looking for something (and who disappears into a wall!) and a maid named "Martha" on a staircase (perhaps the girl mentioned above?). In rooms 6 and 7 inexplicable noises have been heard, the former is said to be haunted by a jilted bride, the other by a jilted brigegroom. They each committed suicide, and may be related to the young girl mentioned above even though neither ghost is said to be visible according to some sources. Other rooms have reported phenomena too; in the Prince Rupert Suite, a depression was often seen on the bed as if someone had been seated there. In the Prince Rupert Lounge (where the titular royal is said to have lived between 1641 and 1644), the (now) owner and a colleague once spent the night. At one point they went away briefly to get a drink and upon returning, their pillows had vanished. After much searching, they were found in the lift. Three ghosts are said to haunt the basement; these include a young Tudor lad named "Thomas". He is said to be encountered near a wall behind which a pond is/was located, and where he drowned. He is reported to have held the hand of a lady for some 20 minutes, leading her through the hotel and down to the area of the pond. Although the lady could feel his hand, the phantom was not observed. Another presence here is one who interferes with people's necks; one regular visitor to the hotel reports the sensation of being clasped around the neck; and a lady felt someone unclasping her necklace.

According to researcher Peter Crawley, "For years mysterious footsteps have been heard climbing stairs in the ladies' powder room. During redecorating in 1981, a hollow panel was found in the room. When this was removed, in true ghost story fashion, a walled-in staircase was found, winding narrowly up to the room above."

Originally called Cannard's Grave and then Cannard's Well, a former landlord received goods stolen by highwayman and smugglers but when he tried his hand at forgery, he was detected and rather than surrender, he committed suicide. His body was buried at the nearby crossroads. It is said that he is seen at the pub and nearby roads, clutching at a "sawn off rope around his neck" and behaving manically.

Floorboards that apparently showed bloodstains in room 9 were removed here. The story is that a squire got a servant girl pregnant, and when he spurned her, she threatened to tell his wife, whereupon the squire chased her into the hall and murdered her in an upstairs room with a knife, hence the "bloodstains". Some grisly versions say that he slit her throat in her sleep; others say that the lady concerned wasn't a servant, but a governess and that he rejected her "due to his limited financial resources"; while some adaptations of the tale say that the squire pursued her out of the building where he murdered her. This latter variant ties in with reports of her running from the farmyard, across Hollow Lane and through a doorway. The sightings are all around September 8th, presumably the date of her murder. She has also apparently been observed inside the hotel, and the sound of an argument heard which was presumably their final quarrel. Additionally, during renovation work, the architect heard strange noises and his dog wouldn't go into an area of the 1st floor. Finally, people have also heard their name called.

A worker employed at the hotel between 2013 and 2017 said that there was a "Grey Lady" there and that sometimes a dark shadow would walk past her into a room, but upon investigation, it was no longer there. In the rooms, TV would turn up by themselves to show static, and items would be found moved. In the meeting room, it was common to hear the sound of children laughing - and a young boy in Victorian clothing was seen there. In the old coal store, which was converted into a staff flat and where a butcher had died of a heart attack, the plug to the TV would come out of the wall - and once, when the employee had finished her shift, the kettle and stand was sitting in the bathroom with no explanation as to how it got there. In the 18th century, a coach used to run between Liverpool and London calling into the Dog and Partridge and people who live in the area sometimes hear the sound of horses and wheels running over cobbles in the early hours.

One of the sons of the owner in 1969/70 awoke to find a grey woman seated on his bed in his attic bedroom. The ghost rose, turned and walked through the wall beside his bed. Later on, after the hotel had been sold, the witnesses's brother visited his old home and was surprised find that another room had been unearthed next to the "haunted room." This new room had initially been noted when the new owners realised that there was an extra window in the attic.  When the wall was taken down, a doorway was revealed which led to an empty room - a doorway that the ghost had walked through. The ghost has been seen at least once since then and recent reports indicate that the phantom is called "The White [sic?] Lady" and nicknamed "Suki."

A man has been seen walking through the closed door of a bedroom, where he stops to look out of the window and go back to the door. Moving furniture and kitchen items, a maid hearing her name called out, and footsteps (and possibly another spectral man?) have also been experienced here too. A military looking ghost in rooms 1 and 2 has been identified as Louis Napoleon (son of the famous Emperor) who lived here in the 1870s; in room 1, actor Roger Moore saw a white, misty figure that floated through the door to his bedside; a maid leaving a bible open at the 23rd Psalm dissuaded the phantom from further visitations; later renovations of the building meant that the wardrobe in this room was disposed of - and the military ghost has not apparently been seen since. A spectral nun, accompanied by the smell of lavender has also been seen on the first floor landing; she has also been seen drifting down the stairs into the restaurant. In the main lounge, an old man has sometimes been seen seated by the fireplace, and a spectral butler observed in one of the front bedrooms. Additionally, there is also a report of a small tabby cat that appeared from nowhere!

In 1999, a local newspaper reported that a "Grey Lady" in a crinoline dress has been seen infrequently in the evening in the restaurant before walking through a wall. Room 1313, just below the bell tower on the 3rd floor of the Tudor Wing, had a marked temperature drop of about 5 degrees around the middle of the room. This ghost is said to be more frequent and had also manifested in drawers being opened, a feeling of something sitting on the edge of the bed, the TV being moved, and the radio and television turning on by themselves. Complaints from neighbouring rooms in the night about the noise from room 1313 have elicited the response that it was unoccupied!

The caves were created by blasting explosives in the rock face by local miner Jack Bates, nicknamed Jack the Blaster. After he died the caves were fashioned into a pub and for a time was the place where smugglers would hide their fare. One smuggler was killed by a custom's official and the legend is that his tankard (which has since been stolen) would be found empty in the morning when filled at night to placate his ghost. Additionally, a ghostly cat, unexplained footsteps (and if legend is to be believed, "bare footprints that will not wash away"), banging and whispering, knockings coming from the cellar, lights being turned on and off, the sounds of a party, objects moving, a poltergeist in the toilets and dark shadows being seen in the caves have been reported. Some say that the screams of long-dead smugglers who were murdered by their comrades or drowned at high tide have been heard. A variant of this story is that a smuggler named Jack (or John) the Jibber was left to starve to death in a barrel here and it is his screams that have been heard. This was his punishment after he informed the authorities of his comrade's illegal activities and they sought vengeance.

There is also another ghost, not so benevolent who dislikes women and is in the cellar. Video footage taken in the pub in September 2020 showed a glass being hurled onto the floor of its own accord.

A grey lady is said to be seen on the first floor and was thought by one of the proprietors to be a nuisance; it does not seem that she is seen very often perhaps due to remodelling of this area. It is thought that the lady was one of two sisters who ran the mill in the 16th or 17th century and was caught in the machinery, killing her. Occasionally, it is said that the river runs red, a spectral remnant of the time a human head was found wedged in the sluice. It seems that a miller in the 19th century had an argument with his wife and in a fit of rage, decapitated her and threw the cranium in the river. The opaque shadow of a heavy man, about 5 feet 8 inches tall and with his arms a little way from its side was once seen in the bar; the witness soon after sought employment at another hotel!

A short while later, the head chef was walking up the stairs to his accommodation when he heard footsteps behind him, and he felt someone come into his room. Apart from this, it would seem that phenomena are few and far between. There is a legend that a Cavalier used to meet a lady much younger than he was. They used to meet secretly in the courtyard here as her parents disapproved of their relationship. It is said that they both died in mysterious circumstances.

She is, or was, said to appear in the corridor outside the room (17) where she met her male guests. In this room, a couple reported that their quilt was being tugged during the night, each of them thinking that the other was to blame! When they woke, they looked to find shadows of about half a dozen people who quickly faded away. The man soon fell asleep but his wife stayed awake and saw a grey lady - a young woman with a bulky body, which was a shapeless mass of dark grey. This spectre also faded away in seconds. In addition, the pub was used as a local court and it is said that one lady who was hanged for murder returned, or returns here after death.

A female ghost has been seen here, wearing a dress with lace cuffs and a white skirt; some say that she is Queen Charlotte who lodged here the year before she died even though the passed away elsewhere. Another phantom is a Grey Lady. Other reported phenomena include a housekeeper who watched a grey figure closing the curtains in a room which proved to be empty upon investigation; voices heard coming from a room that was also unoccupied; and a barman who turned to obtain a bottle for a customer - but upon turning back, the man had vanished.

Poltergeist-like activity has been experienced in the 1220 bar, the oldest part of the hotel. Cold spots, a cleaning notice being flung across the room (and captured on CCTV) and a smashing glass on a tray of other drinks are some of the phenomena reported here. The sound of a crying girl has been heard in "The Seamstress Suite". More recently, a guest observed a party with people dressed in Tudor clothing. When he enquired at the hotel, he was told that no such party had taken place.

Phantom music has been heard in the area above the archway to the courtyard. Once the assembly room, these are now guest rooms and in one of these, a woman saw a girl head into her bathroom; thinking it was her daughter and when she found out she was asleep, they left the hotel the next day! Two members of staff heard their names called out by a young girl as they walked along the corridor outside room 12. Footsteps walking along first floor corridors have also been noted. A former manager could see the televisions on in rooms 15 and 16 while he was walking his dog - these rooms were unoccupied at the time. Another manager's children claimed to see an old lady seated on their bed but the parents found no-one there. Other phenomena include items disappearing and subsequently being found in other parts of the hotel, and a glass being thrown from a shelf and shattering on the ground without human intervention.

The most active ghost here is never seen but heralds its presence with a slamming door, then heavy footsteps along the upstairs corridor followed by silence for a while as the steps reach a window, and then the sound of a woman crying. This may be connected to the sound of hob-nail boots being heard on a stone staircase, which don't exist in the current pub. A phantom miner from the 19th century is reputed to be observed here too; he is connected to an accident at a local mine, and the inquest was held here as the premises had a sufficiently large room. The magistrate was suspicious as he felt he was not getting the information he needed to investigate the death. Soon after, one of the witnesses, a miner, died, and his ghost was then seen walking from the mine to the front door of the pub where he then vanished. During renovation work in the 1980s, the landlady was approached by two men who told her that "no good will come of your work here" - and they promptly vanished! In the lane outside the pub can be heard a shrieking woman. She died when her horse bolted and she was thrown from the carriage. A black monk is also to be seen, but walking away from the pub to a small building at a nearby spring known as The Monk's Conduit, where he was found dead in the 11th century (he may also have been seen inside the pub too; some versions say that he died at his desk in the place now occupied by the bar). Poltergeist-like activity has also been reported, for instance crockery being broken, taps being turned on, glasses jumping from shelves, lights switching on and off, the sound of laughter and items moving without assistance. Other small small phenomena are: a toilet roll placed in the middle of the bedroom floor; interference with the cutlery in the restaurant during the night; and a freezer and washing machine being tipped over in the room above the bar. Finally,the sound of a large bird flying around the bar has been heard, but it is never seen; this is also accompanied by a drop in temperature. The bird is heard to fly through a wall and head off into the distance.

At least one female ghost haunts this pub. A licensee once told of seeing the train of a pale coloured frilly dress on the stairs; the door at the bottom had opened and the dress was pulled through ... but there was no-one there a few second later. This may belong to a phantom woman seen in a guest room; she was described as sitting on the bed and wearing a long pale coloured dress. The same phantom (?) was seen going up the stairs to the top floor having surprised an American guest on the floor below. The spectral girl was said to be about 40, had long blonde hair and a white silky dress, and "fluttered" up the stairs. She was said to be "beautiful." Another female phantom has been described, this time a young girl, apparently from the 16th or 17th century. When seen, she was wearing a long pale blue dress and train, and a hat with scarf over it. She faded away when she was greeted. Other phenomena have also occurred: water was once seen streaming down a beam, but there was no source of liquid above - and no puddle underneath could be found either. A girl who stopped with the daughter of the licensee was in bed and felt something wet touching her side and as she sat upright, she heard a "whoosh" from her side of the bed and out of the closed door. A phantom voice has been heard calling staff member's names - the voice sounded like one of their colleagues or family. It would seem that all is quiet in the pub for the time being...

A ghostly girl is said to haunt this hotel but her origins are unclear. In some versions of the legend, she was the wife of the founder of the hotel, Francis MacNab, who had his wife walled up. The other version is that she was a servant who was made pregnant by MacNab and he threw her out of an upstairs window. Sobbing and weeping coming from one of the bedrooms is the hallmark of the second phantom and it is said that this may be an illegitimate child of MacNab who was drowned in a well in the basement. MacNab himself is also reputed to haunt the hotel.

A "Green Lady" is said to walk here; the story is that a child (or young woman?) accidentally killed herself when she fell down the stairs after finding her father with another woman - the ghost's identity has been suggested as being Elizabeth Davidson. She is said to wear a long silk dress, to whisper "Why?" - and to exude great sadness. The ghost of a maid, and possibly a former owner have also been mentioned. In another incident, a guest woke to find his room icy cold and that he was pinned to the bed. Others have experienced cold "patches of air" too, seen balls of light and heard unexplained bangs, clicks and thuds.

Pitcairn's and Gifford's son, Gideon, was adopted but even though she claimed to have marriage papers Barbara was ostracised by Thomas and his wife and practically exiled from the house, and died at a very young age. A grey haired phantom is supposed to be Elizabeth Mitchell. There have also been other reported phenomena, such as footsteps and electrical interference.

The sound of harp music has been heard issuing from the woods, and are said to be a psychic residue of Gruffydd Evans, who used to play his instrument
every Christmas for 69 years in the Music/Salon Room Nanteos while he was alive. It is reputed that he drowned in the lake.
<br/>Within the hotel, "The Grey Lady" (Elizabeth Owen) is said to meander the corridors searching for her secreted jewelry. She was preoccupied with what would happen to her precious treasures after she died and she hid them within the mansion. She passed away later that night. Apparently, she will haunt anyone who
finds her precious trinkets.
<br/>In the 1800s, Mary, a young nursery maid slept in the room next to the lady of the house who was ill. Mary was awakened by a figure leaning over her, but when she screamed the ghostly intruder stood upright and walked through the closed door. Mary never slept in that room ("The Pink Dressing Room") again! In the 1920s, a lady staying in this room ran out, carrying her items to her friend's room declaring that she was not staying in the room, though she never revealed why.
Another girl staying at the hall was advised not to stay later than midnight. On the one occasion that she did so, and in her haste to depart, she saw a ghostly figure on the staircase. She fainted and injured her head, bed bedridden for three weeks. She was told never to speak of the ghost but eventually she did so, many years later. It was also on the stairs that an army officer saw "a striking woman in evening dress, holding a strange looking candlestick" as he ascended to dress for dinner. He bade her good evening but she proceeded downwards, ignoring him. Returning to the party, he could not find the woman and when he asked about her he was told never to speak of her or there would be a death in the family - which came to pass that night. A few weeks later on a dusty top shelf in the Silver Vault room, the candlestick was found.
<br/>A miscellany of other experiences exist: a guest departed rapidly when he saw smoke in the inner hall, which transformed into a woman in a long flowing dress heading towards the front door. A young girl, aged 7-8, was seen running through the kitchen and the chef heard "Hello Cook". He pursued the child but his search was fruitless and no else had witnessed her, though on other occasions, the shadowy form of a small child has been in the area.
<br/>A TV film crew experiened doors opening and closing, a broken musical box playing by itself and perhaps a cloaked figure that alarmed the personnel so much that they declared that they would not work there after dark. 
In addition to the impressive battery of apparitions, there are also tales of "rumblings" and a sound like moving furniture being dragged and other strange noises, like a gathering of people in the entrance hall at 3.45 a.m., and pebbles or marbles being rolled on the floor.
<br/>An intriguing incident relates to a candle, found blown out one morning in an upstairs bedroom. The previous night it was in the entrance hall window, fully lit with no explanation as to how it had moved overnight.
<br/>Outside the main establishment, the stable yard is the source of the sound of unexplained voices and horses; and when someone peered out at 4 a.m. after hearing the hubbub, the noise stopped. In the Stables Apartment, a baby has been heard crying, and horses have reacted in a nervous fashion to something only they could discern. In the garden, the Groom William Griffiths has been seen standing in the shrubbery as if he awaits someone; he was killed by a garden rake wielded by the Head Gardener Rice Walters in 1782. Intriguing auditory phenomena have been experienced in the rear Court Yard, when a horse and carriage was heard, followed by heavy footsteps entering the back door, and passing through to the kitchen, accompanied by the sound of heavy chains.
